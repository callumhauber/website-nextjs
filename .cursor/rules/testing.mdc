# Testing Guidelines

## Organize Tests Around Features
- Organize tests around features rather than teams or technical layers

## Test Types and Approaches
- Feature Tests serve as the primary driver of development. Begin with a feature test that describes desired behavior.
- Unit Tests act as helpers that validate specific internal implementations. They complement feature tests rather than drive them.
- The distinctions between e2e, integration, and acceptance tests are often overcomplicated. Focus on feature tests and unit tests to deliver meaningful validation.

## Test Readability and Structure
- Tests should read like plain English, use a “given, when, then” approach
- Test names must clearly articulate the feature or functionality under test. This enhances report readability and speeds up debugging when failures occur.
- Each test should focus on a single feature or piece of functionality. Avoid bundling multiple actions (like create, edit, and delete) into one test to maintain clarity and allow for parallelization and caching.
- While it’s acceptable to create helper functions to simplify repetitive tasks (e.g., `page.clickButton('edit')`), ensure these abstractions don’t obscure important setup or action details.
- Validate core flows (e.g., login) once as a feature test. For subsequent tests, use mocks or fixtures to simulate an authenticated state rather than repeatedly testing the login process.
- Treat tests as an integral part of your codebase. Write them with the same care and clarity as production code.
- A well-structured test that clearly describes user behavior minimizes the need for artificial test IDs.

## Folder structure
- Place feature tests under a `tests/feature` folder
- Place unit tests under a `tests/unit` folder

## Environment & Execution Strategy
- Feature tests should be capable of running against multiple configurations (e.g., mock servers, real servers, different environments like qa or production). 
- Even if tests run against mocks, they remain valid as long as the feature behavior is correctly validated.
